## Some explainations about difficulties & solutions:

* I had some problems for the display of the text a the right side of the images of each film.  
Solution: a division, for each film, with the style attribute : "display:inline-block".

* I had to find a new way to display the links to Facebook, twitter & LinkedIn easily at the center of their section.  
Solution: a flex container division with the style attributes : "display : flex" & "justify-content: center".  
And division inside , for each link with the style attribute : "text-align: center".

## My feelings:
It was quite easier than previous works I did.
