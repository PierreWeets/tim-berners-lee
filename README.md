# Exercise
[Requirements](https://github.com/becodeorg/CRL-Woods-3.21/blob/master/LearningPath/01.The-Field/05.HTML-CSS/5-exercice-summary.md)

# Point of interest
* create an image folder with given images
* create a Html page with a given content
* create a Css file (style.css) for the Html page
* try to get the same result as required in the exercice requirements 

## Some explainations about difficulties & solutions:
* I had some problems to display the text, on the right side of the images of each film.  
Solution: a division, for each film, with the style attribute : "display:inline-block".

* I had to find a new way to display the links to Facebook, twitter & LinkedIn easily at the center of their section.  
Solution: a flex container division with the style attributes : "display : flex" & "justify-content: center".  
And division inside , for each link with the style attribute : "text-align: center".

## My feelings:
It was quite easier than previous works I did.
